        <p>Trends in fashion unify women and men around the world, yet they still allow people the ability to portray
            their own individual style at the same time. A period of time portrayed in a picture can be identified
            immediately just by the style of clothes the people are wearing, and this sums up just how powerful and
            all-encompassing fashion is. Fashion can change from one second to the next, but what never changes is the
            hold it has over society, and the role it plays in the modern world. Fashion is so important that whole
            magazines are dedicated to it, TV programs dedicate hours of transmission time to the subject, and people
            discus it between their friends continually.
            .</p>
        <p>To keep up with the latest fashions, people subscribe to fashion magazines, keep a keen eye on what has
            appeared in shops and what has been there for a long time, and go to fashion shows to see what the designers
            are putting on the catwalk this season, and therefore what will make it in to the shops. For the extremely
            wealthy, they might have their own personal relationship with a designer who will keep them well ahead of
            the current trends, therefore, many people wanting to know what the new fashion lines are going to be will
            watch what celebrities are wearing. Being ahead of fashion is for many, the ultimate achievement, although
            being too ahead of the fashion is just as bad as being behind it! If you are too far ahead people will think
            what you are wearing is not in fashion, because it isn’t, yet.

            Designers continue to market the importance they know people put on fashion, and people continue to hang on
            to designers’ every move in the fashion world, therefore as long as this carries on fashion will continue to
            maintain its dominant position in society for a very long time to come. It influences not only what we wear,
            but everything we do, say, and even think. This is why fashion does indeed rule the world.</p>

        <h2>Second Fashion Brand Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="quote">Gucci is not the first brand to announce a change in its runway plans thanks to the coronavirus
            pandemic, which has brought the industry to an effective standstill, closing stores and decimating balance
            sheets. Saint Laurent, also owned by Kering, the Gucci parent company, said it will drop out of the fashion
            show season and follow its own schedule for this year; Dries Van Noten said he will not have a show at all
            until 2021; and Giorgio Armani announced that his men’s and women’s shows will be combined in September, and
            his couture show will be held in January in Milan instead of Paris.</p>
        <p>But Gucci is the first brand to commit to a permanent rethink.

            And though, as is his tendency, Mr. Michele was long on philosophy and short on specifics, his announcement
            could have a domino effect on other brands. It follows those from the Council of Fashion Designers of
            America and the British Fashion Council, which also called for only two seasons a year, and an open letter
            from #rewiringfashion, a group of largely independent brands and retailers that called for a rethink of the
            shows.

            “There should be no rules — imposed by convention or fashion councils — regarding the format of shows, nor
            any expectations that every brand should show every season,” that letter read.</p>
        <p>Gucci wants to change show business. Or, rather, the business of shows. The Italian brand has joined the
            chorus of brands and retailers calling for a permanent reset of the fashion system thanks to Covid-19,
            adding the weight of a giant global name to the movement.
            Mr. Michele also said he was not sure what form, digital or physical, the shows would take, though he
            favored using the terminology of classical music as a reference: symphonies, madrigals, nocturnes,
            overtures. He added that while he was speaking with other brands — “I’m no anarchist” — and the Camera
            Nazionale della Moda, the governing body of Milan Fashion Week, the conversations were ongoing.

            All of which suggests that fragmentation of the entire fashion show experience is increasingly possible.</p>
